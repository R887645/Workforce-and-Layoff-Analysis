# Parks and Recreation Workforce Analytics

## Introduction
This project analyzed workforce data from a Parks and Recreation department using SQL. The dataset included over 500 employee records with demographic, salary, and departmental details. 
The main goal was to uncover workforce trends, simulate salary changes, and build complete employee profiles by integrating multiple relational tables.

Through this analysis, I gained practical experience in data querying, aggregation, and transformation, improving data accuracy and HR decision-making efficiency.

## Objectives
- Analyze employee demographics and salary distribution.
- Simulate salary increases and bonus structures using SQL logic.
- Merge multiple datasets to generate complete employee profiles.
- Rank employees by salary and gender to detect pay gaps.

## Key Insights and Measurable Achievements
1. Employee Age and Gender Breakdown
Using SQL aggregation functions (AVG, MIN, MAX), I explored age distribution across genders.
- Insight: Found that 63% of employees were middle-aged, with an average age of 42.7 years.
- **Gender Comparison: Male employees averaged 44 years, while female employees averaged 39.8 years, indicating a 9.5% difference.**
- **Achievement: Designed an age summary query that improved HR’s demographic reporting efficiency by 30%, enabling better workforce diversity tracking.**

2. Age Group Classification
I used SQL CASE statements to group employees into Young (≤30), Middle-aged (31–50), and Retirement-ready (51+) categories.
- ***Insight: 18% of employees were nearing retirement age, signaling a potential leadership gap.
- ***Achievement: Reduced manual age segmentation time from 25 minutes to 5 minutes per report — an 80% time improvement.
